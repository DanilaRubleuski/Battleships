## 📜General info📜
This is my implementation of simple one-side Battleships game! 
It is represented as a console application, a strategy type  ***Battleships*** (or ***Sea Battle***) game. 
## 🤷How to open?🤷

You need to download the repository and launch **Main.java** file. Put down your name and play 🙂

## 🎮Controls🎮

After placing the ships on the field, enter the coordinates where you would like to shoot in the letter-number format (e.g. "A5").

## 📋Rules📋

There are 3 ships on the field - 1 aircraft carrier (5 cells) and 2 destroyers (4 cells). The game ends with your victory after successfully sinking all three ships.

If you missed a shot - it marks as "o" on the board. If you hit a battleship - this point marks as "X".
